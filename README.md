Kidney stones, also known as renal calculi, are a prevalent medical condition 
affecting millions worldwide.  The kidney stone detection has several valuable applications 
in the medical field. Firstly, it can assist radiologists and urologists in accurately identifying 
kidney stones from CT scan images, reducing the time required for manual analysis and 
improving diagnostic accuracy. Secondly, early detection of kidney stones can lead to more 
effective treatment plans and better patient outcomes. Moreover, the approach can be 
integrated into computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, enhancing the overall efficiency 
of medical image analysis and supporting healthcare professionals in their decision-making 
process. Existing methods for kidney stone detection often rely on manual inspection by 
radiologists, which can be time-consuming and subjective. Some automated approaches 
use traditional image processing techniques, such as thresholding and edge detection, but 
they may struggle with accurately identifying kidney stones in complex CT scan images 
due to variations in stone size, shape, and intensity. Additionally, traditional regression 
methods might struggle with noise and artifacts commonly present in medical images, 
leading to reduced accuracy. This work presents a novel approach for kidney stone 
detection in CT scan images, leveraging the combined power of image processing and 
machine learning techniques such as Random Forest Algorithm. The integration of image 
processing and machine learning techniques addresses the drawbacks of existing methods 
and provides a reliable, efficient, and automated solution for early detection and diagnosis.
